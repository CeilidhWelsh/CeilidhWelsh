### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ceilidh (she/her), a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge - viva pending! My research investigates predictive biomarkers and computational models for understanding and predicting radiotherapy response.  

I spend most of my time doing research analysis and visualisations using medical data anywhere from investigating common genetic variants to CT image radiotherapy biomarkers. I'm particularly interested in FAIR data principles, ethical data practices and how we can produce reproducible models and analysis pipelines across scientific fields. 

My current work has ranged across a series of projects: 
  - ðŸ§¬ Reproducible Pipeline for Biomarker Investigation: building a robust and reproducible modular pipeline for investigating CT image biomarkers that ensures transparency and facilitates collaboration and validation of findings 
  - ðŸ“š Contributing to Open Source Projects: see our research-group developed Python package [scikit-rt](https://github.com/scikit-rt/scikit-rt) and _The Turing Way_
  - ðŸ“Š Data Ethics and Reproducibility: [organising a symposium](https://github.com/Susana465/der_symposium_20230310) on data ethics, contributing to open-access resources for [data reproducibility and ethics](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/data-hazards), [Data Hazards Project](https://datahazards.com/) for an open-source vocabulary for data ethics, and participating in discussions and collaborations as part of [community-led projects.](https://crukcambridgecentre.org.uk/research/strategic/radnet/timeline)
